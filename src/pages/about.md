## About

Dapp Dir was created to improve the state of censorship resistant applications in the Ethereum ecosystem. It provides users with a way to assess the risk of dapps at a glance, and gives them the ability to pin them locally.
The risk assessment and scoring system also gives developers a way to see how they are doing and how they can improve the censorship resistance of their dapps.

### Why is this important?

Many builders compromise when building their applications, and understandably so. Building an app that can be fully distributed using the ENS + IPFS combo is a significant hurdle for many developers.
This constraint puts limits on how fast you can move and how quickly you can grow your application, at least for now. So why build applications in this way? You do it out of care for your users.
People actually want tools that are resilient and that doesn't go away when the builder abandons the project. There is also the problem of censorship. There are multiple examples of applications
disappearing or becoming unusable because the builder or an oppressive government decided to take it down.

We need to do better! We need to celebrate builders that go through the effort of serving their users fully. This is why Dapp Dir exists.

### How can I help?
